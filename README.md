# Communicate-Data-Findings
In two parts of this project, data visualization techniques are demonstrated as important
and valuable for data analysis. Using Python visualization libraries, I will analyze a
selected dataset systematically, building up from single variable plots to multiple
variable plots. the second task will be to create a short presentation that illustrates
interesting properties. Trends and relationships found within the dataset you selected.
Transforming my findings will be the primary method of expressing your findings
Translate my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory
visualizations.
